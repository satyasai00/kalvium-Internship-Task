I've been working to scrape election data with Python.  Using requests and BeautifulSoup libraries, I could pull important details - who the candidates were, what parties they belonged to, which constituencies they ran in, and how many seats they got.  I organized all the messy data I collected into clean tables and CSV files using pandas so it'll be easier to work with later.  Then I brought that CSV file into Power BI to build visual reports and dashboards to analyze the heck out of these election results from all angles.
